This calculator is my first proper Javascript project!

Although I feel comfortable with programming concepts such as looping, arrays, switch statements and iteration methods, knowing how to start this project proved quite difficult, as did learning to think like a programmer.

Now that I feel much more confident with CSS, I truly enjoyed designing and building the front-end of the calculator.

The calculator is adapted for mobile and tablet currently; I made the tablet version responsive to the browser size in order to experiment with responsive percentages.

I am proud of what I have accomplished in this project and I am extremely proud of taking my first steps along the long road to becoming a great programmer.
